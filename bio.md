My name is Matthew Chung. I am currently attending Oregon State University as an eCampus student.
I live in Binghamton, New York, and I enjoy playing video games and watching movies. I would love to learn as much as possible from this course and be able to create interactive games on this
web site. I have a maltese dog called Louie and I enjoy taking him to dog parks as well.

Programming Background
My programming background includes about 5 courses prior to taking this course. The courses I took include CS161, CS162, CS225, CS261, and CS271. From this experience, I was able to learn
to code in C, C++, and Assembly Language (MASM), as well as to understand basic logic and various
data structures such as array, linked lists, stack, bag, tec.

My favorite project I have done so far in OSU was my CS161 final project. In it, the professor
asked the students to make any project they'd like as long as they satisfy the code
requirements. For my project, I made a Blackjack game, with some graphic elements using arrays.
I liked the game a lot that I play the game even during my spare time!


Conclusion:
As much as I like this course, I may find this course to be very tough because it involves many moving parts. I may ask many questions, so please bear with me!
